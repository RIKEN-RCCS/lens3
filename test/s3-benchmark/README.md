# Notes

This is a copy of s3-benchmark by wasabi-tech.  This part is
copyrighted by wasabi-tech and the license is LGPL.  The code is very
modified for "aws-sdk-go-v2" from "aws-sdk-go" v1 in the original.
The code is very simplified to use s3.GetObject and s3.PutObject, but
drops the control of the access rates.
